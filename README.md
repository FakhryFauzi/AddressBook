# AddressBook
A simple address book using java spring mvc

What we did in this project:

1.) Created a web application using Java Spring MVC

2.) Made a dynamic table with the ability to add and remove data using Javascript

Future planned updates: 

1.) Add function to download the address table

2.) Store the data into the back-end (Java) using ajax so that it can be retrieved/edited in the backend

The CSS and Style of the page used is from SB-admin-2 and is NOT my own work
